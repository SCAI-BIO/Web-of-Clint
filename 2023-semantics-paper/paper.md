## what is the web of data

The Web of Data is a term used to describe a collection of interrelated datasets on the web, also known as Linked Data[1]. It is a part of the Semantic Web, which is a web of data that provides an environment where applications can query data, draw inferences using vocabularies, and more[1]. The Semantic Web is made up of various technologies, including RDF, OWL, SKOS, and SPARQL[1]. To make the Web of Data a reality, it is important to have a huge amount of data on the web available in a standard format, reachable and manageable by Semantic Web tools[1].
Linked Data is about the use of URIs as names for things, the ability to dereference these URIs to get further information, and to include links to other data[2]. There are ever-increasing sources of Linked Open Data on the web, as well as data services that are restricted to the suppliers and consumers of those services[2]. The Web of Data is made of structured data read by agents that relate structured data located in servers through the existence of links[3]. The data that exists in the Web of Data is called metadata[3].
The Web of Data is becoming increasingly important to society, and the W3C has a mature suite of web standards with plans for further work on making it easier for average developers to work with graph data and knowledge graphs[2]. Traditional approaches to data have focused on tabular databases, CSV files, and data embedded in PDF documents and spreadsheets, but there is now a major shift to graph data with nodes and labeled directed links between them[2]. Graph data is faster than using SQL and associated JOIN operations and is better suited to wide data management and governance, reflecting the strategic importance of data to modern businesses[2].

## what are some examples of the web of data in use

The Web of Data is a concept that is being used in various fields such as e-commerce, education, research, and more. Linked Data is a key aspect of the Web of Data, which is about the use of URIs as names for things, the ability to dereference these URIs to get further information, and to include links to other data[1]. The Semantic Web technologies such as RDF, OWL, SKOS, and SPARQL provide an environment where applications can query that data, draw inferences using vocabularies, and more[2].
One example of the Web of Data in use is in e-commerce, where it is used to provide more personalized and relevant product recommendations to customers based on their browsing and purchase history[3]. Another example is in education, where the Web of Data is used to provide more personalized and adaptive learning experiences to students based on their learning preferences and progress[3]. In research, the Web of Data is used to connect and integrate data from various sources to enable more comprehensive and accurate analysis[3].
Overall, the Web of Data is being used in various fields to enable more efficient, accurate, and personalized data management and analysis. It is a powerful concept that is transforming the way we interact with and use data.

The Semantic Web is a Web of Data — of dates and titles and part numbers and chemical properties and any other data one might conceive of. The collection of Semantic Web technologies (RDF, OWL, SKOS, SPARQL, etc.) provides an environment where application can query that data, draw inferences using vocabularies, etc.
