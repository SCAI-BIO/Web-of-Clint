# The State of the Art

Semantic technologies have proven their value a long time ago when Gene Ontology enabled the comparison of functional repertoires encoded in different genomes across several species. Controlling name spaces and their meaning was and is essential not only for data integration, but also for information retrieval and information extraction. More recently, the necessity of independent validation of findings based on machine learning (“AI-based modeling and mining”) has underpinned the need for the semantic harmonization of entire data- and knowledge-landscapes. The advent of AI in public health now puts an even greater pressure on the ability to establish shared semantics and to use them for the semantic harmonization of heterogeneous, distributed data sets. 

Knowledge graphs are representations of findings in a form that makes them amenable to AI-based modeling and mining approaches. Knowledge graphs are also rather convenient representations to improve the interoperability between data and knowledge, as algorithms integrating a priori knowledge in the form of graphs (“embeddings”) gain more and more momentum in AI-powered data analytics. 

A good starting point for any “wide” approach to a public health / pandemic intelligence topic is the creation of an overview of the entities and concepts used to communicate knowledge about that specific topic. Despite its undisputed importance, the public health area has no shared semantics yet. The reasons for this may be diverse, but the strong influence of statistics in epidemiology may have played a role in the underrepresentation of semantics in public health. After all, statistical interoperability is quite different from semantic interoperability, and we should not forget about that in the following discussion. 

The process of generating an overview on relevant data often results in the generation of “data catalogues” that list data sets, their (DataCite) unique identifiers, their source and ownership plus additional, useful information (e.g., access procedures; formats; rules for privacy protection, etc.). Generation of these data catalogues requires a comprehensive overview on available / published data and the thematic focus (“scope”) of the data catalogue. A searchable version of a data catalogue requires shared semantics annotations (unified metadata annotations) based on controlled vocabularies (ontologies / terminologies / thesauri). 

Shared semantics and harmonized annotations are essential for FAIR data as shared semantics represent the lowest level of the entire “interoperability” aspect. Of course, for modeling and mining, statistical equivalence is even more important, but before we can establish statistical equivalence, we need to clarify the equivalence at the semantics level. 


## Selection of relevant data sources

### Preliminary assembly of semantic resources potentially relevant for pandemic intelligence and global public health

The following overview is a preliminary assembly of semantic resources potentially relevant for pandemic intelligence and global public health:
